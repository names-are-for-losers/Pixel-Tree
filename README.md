# Pixel Tree
 Pixel Tree is a Minecraft resource pack or texture pack that works best on version 1.21.3 of java edition. This texture pack is prides itself on being purely a vanilla texture pack that does not need optifine or any other extention to work.

 ## Details
 This texture pack is thematic, and likes straying off of the usual textures with creative, unique, and immersive art, that gives the player a fresh experience to the game's world and user interface. 
 - Firstly, the this texture pack's main resolution is 32×32, however, mobs are all drawn at 64×64 due to the bigger size of pixels for mobs.
 - Secondly, the texture pack is only worked on by one individual. That's why updates might be slower than usual, but this does not change the fact that an attempt at creating a bedrock version is in the works.
 - Lastly all the art and textures in the texture pack are own in whole by Nitgo.
